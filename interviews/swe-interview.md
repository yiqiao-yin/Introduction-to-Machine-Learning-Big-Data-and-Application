# Software Engineering Interviews

Software engineering interviews often test a candidate's ability to solve problems, write code, and communicate their thought process. In this guide, we will discuss several key concepts that frequently come up in these interviews, along with Python examples for each.

## Big O

**Simple Explanation**: Big O notation is a way to describe how long an algorithm takes to run or how much memory it uses as the size of the input increases. It gives us an upper bound on the runtime.

### Tricks

1. Include all the things
2. Use logiscal variable names
3. Define the variables you need
4. Adding vs. multiplying
5. Drop constants
6. Use big-O for space; remember the call stack!
7. Drop non-dominant terms

**Example**:
Suppose we want to find if a number exists in a list. One way is to look at each number until we find it.

```python
def find_num(lst, num):
    for n in lst:
        if n == num:
            return True
    return False
```

The time it takes grows linearly with the size of the list, so we say it's \(O(n)\).

### Big O Notations and Examples

Let's expand on the Big O topic by discussing various common Big O notations and providing examples for each.

#### \( O(1) \) - Constant Time

**Simple Explanation**: An algorithm is \( O(1) \) if its runtime doesn't change as the input size increases. It always takes a constant amount of time.

**Example**:
Accessing an element from an array using its index.

```python
def get_element(arr, index):
    return arr[index]
```

#### \( O(\log n) \) - Logarithmic Time

**Simple Explanation**: An algorithm is \( O(\log n) \) if the number of operations is proportional to the logarithm of the input size. Binary search is a classic example.

**Example**:
Binary search in a sorted array.

```python
def binary_search(arr, x):
    l, r = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if arr[mid] == x:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < x:
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
    return -1
```

#### \( O(n) \) - Linear Time

**Simple Explanation**: An algorithm is \( O(n) \) if its runtime grows linearly with the input size.

**Example**:
Finding the maximum value in an array.

```python
def find_max(arr):
    maximum = arr[0]
    for num in arr:
        if num > maximum:
            maximum = num
    return maximum
```

#### \( O(n \log n) \) - Linear Logarithmic Time

**Simple Explanation**: Common in algorithms that divide the input in each step. Many efficient sorting algorithms have this time complexity.

**Example**:
Merge sort.

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
    right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])
    return merge(left, right)

def merge(left, right):
    result = []
    i = j = 0
    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] < right[j]:
            result.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(right[j])
            j += 1
    result.extend(left[i:])
    result.extend(right[j:])
    return result
```

#### \( O(n^2) \) - Quadratic Time

**Simple Explanation**: Algorithms with nested loops often have a quadratic time complexity.

**Example**:
Bubble sort.

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

#### \( O(2^n) \) - Exponential Time

**Simple Explanation**: Algorithms with this time complexity double their runtime with each additional input element. Recursive algorithms that solve a problem of size \( n \) by recursively solving two smaller problems of size \( n-1 \) often have this time complexity.

**Example**:
Recursive calculation of the nth Fibonacci number.

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

#### \( O(n!) \) - Factorial Time

**Simple Explanation**: Algorithms with this time complexity grow extremely fast and can become impractical even for small input sizes. Commonly seen in brute-force solutions.

**Example**:
Generating all possible permutations of a list.

```python
def permutations(lst):
    if len(lst) == 0:
        return [[]]
    perms = []
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        rest = lst[:i] + lst[i+1:]
        for p in permutations(rest):
            perms.append([lst[i]] + p)
    return perms
```


These are just a few examples of Big O notations. Understanding the time complexity of algorithms is crucial for writing efficient code and excelling in technical interviews.

## Problem Solving

**Simple Explanation**: Problem-solving is the process of defining a problem and determining a solution to that problem.

**Example**:
Find the sum of all numbers up to a given number.

```python
def sum_upto_n(n):
    return n * (n + 1) // 2
```

### The Seven Steps Tips

1. Listen carefully what the problem is.
2. Draw an example which serves as input and output.
3. Come up with a brute force first. Ask yourself, what's a stupid way of doing this?
4. Optimize the solution and make sure to spend good chunk of time here. Analyze it with space-time complexity. 
5. Walk through the algorithm before you start coding. This is like looking at a map before you start driving. 
6. Write the code. Typically the interviewer doesn't require you to run the code, but rather 2) want to hear the thought process, and 2) don't want to bogged down in syntactical details or writing surrounding classes.
7. Veriffication. You want to verify the code and make sure it is bug-free to the best of your ability.

### Optimizing with BUD

BUD is short for:

- B: Bottlenecks
- U: Unnecessary work
- D: Duplicated work

### Best Conveivable Runtime

"Best conceivable runtime" is about the problem, not a specific algorithm. It has nothing to do with the best case / worst case runtime. 

## Coding

**Simple Explanation**: Coding is the act of translating a solution or algorithm into a programming language so that a computer can execute it.

**Example**:
Write code to reverse a string.

```python
def reverse_string(s):
    return s[::-1]
```

### Use Type Hints

Let's dive deeper into the topic of "Coding" by discussing type hints in Python.

In modern Python programming, type hints are an essential tool that enhance code readability and allow for better static type checking. Introduced in Python 3.5 through [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/), type hints provide a way to specify the expected data types of function arguments and return values. This makes it easier for developers to understand how a function should be used and can help prevent certain types of bugs.

#### Basic Type Hints

For basic data types like integers, strings, and floats, you can use the built-in Python classes as type hints.

**Example**:
```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return "Hello, " + name
```

Here, the `name` parameter is expected to be a string, and the function is also expected to return a string.

#### Lists, Dictionaries, and Other Collections

For collections, you can use the `List`, `Dict`, `Set`, and `Tuple` types from the `typing` module.

**Example**:
```python
from typing import List, Dict

def average(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

def get_student_grades(grades: Dict[str, float]) -> List[float]:
    return list(grades.values())
```

#### Custom Types

For custom classes and data structures, you can use the class name as a type hint.

**Example**:
```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name: str, age: int):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

def register_student(student: Student) -> None:
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

#### Optional Types and None

Sometimes, a variable can be of a specific type or `None`. In such cases, you can use the `Optional` type from the `typing` module.

**Example**:
```python
from typing import Optional

def find_student(name: str) -> Optional[Student]:
    # If the student is found, return the Student object, otherwise return None
    pass
```

#### Benefits of Using Type Hints

1. **Improved Code Readability**: Type hints make it clear what types of arguments are expected and what type of value a function will return.
2. **Better Developer Experience**: Integrated development environments (IDEs) can use type hints to provide better auto-completions, warnings, and refactoring capabilities.
3. **Static Type Checking**: Tools like [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) can be used to perform static type checking based on type hints, catching potential type-related errors before runtime.

---

Incorporating type hints into your Python code can greatly enhance its clarity and maintainability. While Python remains a dynamically typed language, type hints offer a way to harness some of the benefits of static typing without sacrificing the language's flexibility.

## Verification

**Simple Explanation**: Verification involves checking that your code works correctly for all possible inputs.

**Example**:
Verify that the reverse function works.

```python
def test_reverse_string():
    assert reverse_string("hello") == "olleh"
    assert reverse_string("world") == "dlrow"
```

## Communication

**Simple Explanation**: Communication involves explaining your thought process, your code, and any decisions you made while solving a problem.

**Example**:
"I chose a hash table for this problem because it allows for constant time lookups, which will make the solution faster."

## Arrays

**Simple Explanation**: An array is a collection of items, where each item can be identified by an index.

**Example**:
Find the maximum value in an array.

```python
def find_max(arr):
    return max(arr)
```

## Strings

**Simple Explanation**: A string is a sequence of characters.

**Example**:
Check if a string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]
```

## Hash Tables

**Simple Explanation**: A hash table (or dictionary in Python) is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. Hash tables are a cornerstone of efficient algorithmic design, offering rapid access to data. Key attributes include:

- **Speed**: Hash tables typically allow for constant time average complexity for search operations, making data retrieval swift.
- **Key-Value Pairs**: Data is stored in key-value pairs, where each unique key maps to a specific value.
- **Collisions**: Since multiple keys might hash to the same index, handling collisions is essential. Common strategies include chaining (where each table entry references a list of all key-value pairs that hash to the same index) and open addressing (where alternative slots are sought in the array).
- **Dynamic Resizing**: To maintain efficiency, a hash table can be resized, often doubling its capacity when it's about to be filled and halving when it's less used.
- **Use Cases**: They're invaluable for tasks like data deduplication, counting distinct elements, and cache implementations.

The design and implementation of a hash table significantly influence the efficiency of algorithms that utilize it.

**Example**:
Count the frequency of each character in a string.

```python
def char_frequency(s):
    freq = {}
    for char in s:
        freq[char] = freq.get(char, 0) + 1
    return freq
```

## Search

**Simple Explanation**: Searching is the process of finding a particular item in a collection.

**Example**:
Binary search in a sorted array.

```python
def binary_search(arr, x):
    l, r = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if arr[mid] == x:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < x:
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
    return -1
```

## Sorting

**Simple Explanation**: Sorting is the process of arranging items in a particular order (ascending or descending).

**Example**:
Bubble sort.

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

## Recursion

**Simple Explanation**: Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem.

**Example**:
Find the factorial of a number.

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n-1)
```

## Stacks

**Simple Explanation**: A stack is a collection of items where the last item added is the first item removed (Last-In-First-Out).

**Example**:
Check for balanced parentheses using a stack.

```python
def are_parentheses_balanced(s):
    stack = []
    mapping = {")": "(", "]": "[", "}": "{"}
    for char in s:
        if char in mapping:
            top_element = stack.pop() if stack else '#'
            if mapping[char] != top_element:
                return False
        else:
            stack.append(char)
    return not stack
```

## Queues

**Simple Explanation**: A queue is a collection of items where the first item added is the first item removed (First-In-First-Out or FIFO). It's like a line at a grocery store checkout.

**Example**:
Using Python's `queue` module to create a simple queue.

```python
import queue

q = queue.Queue()
q.put(1)
q.put(2)
q.put(3)

# The first item to be removed will be 1
print(q.get())  # Output: 1
```

## Trees

**Simple Explanation**: A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. The topmost node is called the root, and nodes with no children are called leaves.

**Example**:
Defining a simple binary tree.

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

root = TreeNode(10)
root.left = TreeNode(5)
root.right = TreeNode(20)
```

## Heaps

**Simple Explanation**: A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. For a max heap, for any given node I, the value of I is greater than the values of its children. For a min heap, it's the opposite.

**Example**:
Using Python's `heapq` module to create a min-heap.

```python
import heapq

heap = []
heapq.heappush(heap, 10)
heapq.heappush(heap, 5)
heapq.heappush(heap, 20)

# The smallest item will be popped first
print(heapq.heappop(heap))  # Output: 5
```

## Graphs

**Simple Explanation**: A graph is a collection of nodes (or vertices) and edges that connect these nodes. It can be used to represent many real-world systems like networks, roads, etc.

**Example**:
Representing a simple undirected graph using an adjacency list.

```python
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['A', 'D', 'E'],
    'C': ['A', 'F'],
    'D': ['B'],
    'E': ['B', 'F'],
    'F': ['C', 'E']
}
```

## Greedy Algorithms

**Simple Explanation**: Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step with the hopes of finding a global optimum. They don't always guarantee the best solution, but they are often fast and good for optimization problems.

**Example**:
The coin change problem. Given coins of certain denominations and a total amount, find the minimum number of coins that make up that amount.

```python
def coin_change(coins, amount):
    coins.sort(reverse=True)
    count = 0
    for coin in coins:
        if amount == 0:
            break
        num_coins = amount // coin
        count += num_coins
        amount -= coin * num_coins
    return count if amount == 0 else -1

print(coin_change([1, 2, 5], 11))  # Output: 3 (5 + 5 + 1)
```
