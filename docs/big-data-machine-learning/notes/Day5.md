# Linear Regression

Linear regression is the statistical model that learns from $X$ and predicts $Y$. Model is usually formulated in the following setup. 

Suppose we are given $X_1$ and $X_2$. Suppose also we want to predict $Y$. The term regression comes from regress which means the goal is 
$$\mathbb{E}(Y - \mathbb{E}(Y|X))$$
