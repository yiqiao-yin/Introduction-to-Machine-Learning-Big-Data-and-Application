# Trader and Investor

The first basic difference is in classifying types of trades in a brokerage account. In a regular brokerage account for equity tradings (ETrade, Scottrade, Charles Schwab, etc.), a trade or a position is recorded as trading if the length of the holding is less than a year. If the length of holding is longer than a year, it is recorded as an investment. This is a rather easy understanding of the difference between trader and investor. The common sense here is that the investors would hold positions for much longer period and they would focus on stock picking. Traders would enter and exit much more frequently. The decisions are usually determined based on sentiment or chart analysis.

# Fama French 3-Factor Model

The Fama French 3-Factor Model, or [FF3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fama%E2%80%93French_three-factor_model), is a factor-based model and it describes the behavior of cross sectional stock returns. It is later on used as tools and the fundamentals of factor-based trading which launched the entire field of algorithmic trading.

# Brownian Motion and Stock Returns

A reasonable person would feel indifferent and would have realized very little difference between the animation of a Bronian Motion versus that of stock returns.
